# Traffic_Light_Control_System-ATmega32
This project works as an On-demand Traffic Light Control System, which is controlled by an ATmega32 microcontroller. The cars' traffic lights are represented with 3 LEDs, the pedestrian lights with 3 LEDs and there is a pedestrian push button which adjusts the traffic lights when pressed to allow the pedestrian to cross the street.

This project is implemented in C language using Microchip Studio.
